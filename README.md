# Madness

Alternative Powershell GUI for basic managment of Active Directory accounts.

A little hacky, and probably has bugs, but also pretty simple compared to other options.

Probably won't work straight out of the box, but shouldn't need too much tweaking.

Needs a recent-ish version of Powershell (4.0 works for me):
```
   PS C:\Users\Administrator> $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
   Major  Minor  Build  Revision
   -----  -----  -----  --------
   4      0      -1     -1
```

Please don't ask me to write Powershell for you.
